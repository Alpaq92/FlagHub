# Changelog

All notable changes to FlagHub.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Entries under `[Unreleased]` are appended automatically by `.github/workflows/changelog.yml` when a PR is merged into `main`. Rename `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` at release time (the release workflow can also do this).

## [3.0.4] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- Five flags previously absent from the upstream set: **AQ** (Antarctica), **BQ** (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba), **DG** (Diego Garcia / BIOT), **EH** (Western Sahara), **IC** (Canary Islands — simplified tricolor, no coat of arms). Ported from [`murgupluoglu/flagkit-android`](https://github.com/murgupluoglu/flagkit-android) (MIT) via a VectorDrawable → SVG converter at `scripts/port_flags_from_android.py`. Tier-3 issues [#36](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/36), [#73](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/73), [#83](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/83), [#84](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/84), [#97](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/97), [#101](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/101) are partially resolved; AC, CP, EA, TA remain absent.
- `icon.png` at repo root — a royal-blue wireframe globe (from icones.pro, [license](https://icones.pro/en/icon-license/)) on a white-to-cool-grey round gradient plate with subtle glass treatments and a drop-shadow + sphere-lighting gradient on the glyph. Regeneration script: `scripts/generate_icon.py`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: asset scope narrowed to **geo-political flags only** — sovereign states, dependencies, sub-national entities, and intergovernmental bodies (EU, WW). One non-geo-political code that upstream FlagKit shipped was removed accordingly; consumers who depended on it can take the artwork from upstream FlagKit or supply their own asset. Net effect with the five additions above: `Flag.supportedCountryCodes.count` is **260** (was 256: +5 ports, −1 removal).

## [3.0.3] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- xcframework release artefact is now functional. Three issues stacked: (1) a module-name shadow that broke `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES` builds (resolved by renaming the internal `FlagHub` namespace to `FlagHubBundle`, fixed in 3.0.2); (2) SPM library targets don't produce `.framework` bundles via `xcodebuild archive`, so the create-xcframework step would fail to find any framework — switched to [`segment-integrations/swift-create-xcframework`](https://github.com/segment-integrations/swift-create-xcframework) (pinned to commit `33079d3`); (3) the tool's generated project omits the SPM resource bundle target, so `Bundle.module` was unavailable and flag artwork was missing — release.yml now injects `FlagHub_FlagHub.bundle` into each framework slice post-build, and the runtime bundle lookup falls through to that nested bundle when Xcode-wrapped.

### Added
- Binary `FlagHub-<version>-xcframework.tar.gz` attached to GitHub Releases alongside the source tarball. Five slices: `ios-arm64`, `ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator`, `macos-arm64_x86_64`, `tvos-arm64`, `tvos-arm64_x86_64-simulator`. visionOS slice can follow once the upstream tool supports it cleanly.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-28

Initial fork-flagkit release. See [docs/OVERVIEW.md](docs/OVERVIEW.md) for the full audit trail.

### Merged
- All seven open upstream pull requests ([#65](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/65), [#79](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/79), [#82](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/82), [#100](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/100), [#107](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/107), [#109](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/109), [#110](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/pull/110))

### Fixed
- SVG element IDs are scoped per file to prevent cross-document `url(#…)` collisions ([#66](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/66))
- CH and VA are now square (15 × 15) ([#91](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/91))
- WW (world / default) flag restored from upstream pre-2.0 history ([#95](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/95))
- Broken sample-project link removed from README ([#98](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/98))
- `FlagHub.podspec` uses the correct `s.resources` attribute (PR #100's `s.resource_bundle` was invalid DSL and would have silently dropped the asset catalog at `pod install` time)

### Added
- `Flag.all` and `Flag.supportedCountryCodes` ([#92](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/92))
- SwiftUI `Image(flag:)`, `Image(flagWithCountryCode:)`, `Image(flagWithCountryCode:style:)` ([#93](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/93))
- MIT attribution comment on every SVG ([#106](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/issues/106))
- GitHub Actions pipeline: CI, CodeQL, gitleaks + dependency-review + Trivy security, auto-merge after 7 days with code-owner / collaborator / CodeRabbit approval, release build with xcframework on push to main and GitHub Release on `v*.*.*` tags
- CodeRabbit config (`.coderabbit.yaml`), CODEOWNERS

### Changed
- Every PNG in the repo losslessly recompressed with `oxipng -o 6` (2.3 MiB → 1.4 MiB, –41.7 %)
- Title banner rebranded to "FlagHub 3.0" with a soft white glow for dark-mode legibility
- `LICENSE` now carries an additional `Copyright (c) 2026 Alpaq92` line; original Bowtie AB notice preserved
- `.gitignore` expanded for Python tooling (`scripts/`), Windows, Linux, IDE artefacts
- README slimmed to a quick pitch; full project state in [docs/OVERVIEW.md](docs/OVERVIEW.md)
